            <h1>DEEP WEB</h1></a>
    
    <strong><u>Tragic</strong></u>
    <br><br> The first confl(a)tion of the terms "deep web" with "dark web" happened during 2009 when deep web search terminology was discussed together with illegal activities occurring on the Freenet and darknet.
    Tho(s)e criminal activities include the commerce of personal passwords, false identity documents, drugs, firearms, and child pornography.
Since then, after their use in the media's reporting on the black-market website Silk Road, media outlets have generally used 'deep web' synonymously with the dark web or darknet, a comparison some reject as inaccurate and consequently has become an ongoing source of confusion. 
Wired reporters (K)im Zetter and Andy Greenberg recommend the terms be used (i)n distinct fashions. While the deep web is a reference to any site that cannot be accessed by a traditional search engine,
 the dark web is a portion of the deep web that has been hidden intentionally and is inaccessible by standard browsers and methods. CODE <br>
